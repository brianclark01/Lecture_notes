Tasks for Alice:

Create the Products table with the following columns: ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price, and StockQuantity.
Create the Shipments table with the following columns: ShipmentID, ProductID, ShipmentDate, Destination, and Quantity.
Create the Transactions table with the following columns: TransactionID, ShipmentID, TransactionDate, Amount, and PaymentStatus.
Rename the Products table to SupplyChainProducts to better reflect its role in the system.
Alter the Shipments table to add a new column ShipmentStatus to track the status of each shipment (e.g., Pending, Shipped, Delivered).


Note: The user must write only the query to create, rename, and alter the table. The query to display the description of the table is already given.

Input format :
No console input

Output format :
The output displays the successful table creation status and the structure of all three tables

Answer : 

-- Create the Products table
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID NUMBER,
    ProductName VARCHAR2(255),
    Category VARCHAR2(100),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    StockQuantity NUMBER
);

-- Create the Shipments table
CREATE TABLE Shipments (
    ShipmentID NUMBER,
    ProductID NUMBER,
    ShipmentDate DATE,
    Destination VARCHAR2(255),
    Quantity NUMBER
);

-- Create the Transactions table
CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    TransactionID NUMBER,
    ShipmentID NUMBER,
    TransactionDate DATE,
    Amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    PaymentStatus VARCHAR2(50)
);

-- Rename the Products table to SupplyChainProducts
ALTER TABLE Products 
RENAME TO SupplyChainProducts;

-- Alter the Shipments table to add ShipmentStatus column
ALTER TABLE Shipments 
ADD ShipmentStatus VARCHAR2(50);
