# 📘 Lesson 14: **Deque & Priority Queue**


## ↔️ Deque (Double-Ended Queue)

A **Deque** (pronounced *"deck"*) allows insertion and deletion from both **front** and **rear**, unlike standard queues.

### 📚 Types of Deques

* 🔹 **Input-Restricted Deque** → Insert only at rear; delete from both ends.
* 🔹 **Output-Restricted Deque** → Insert at both ends; delete only from front.

### 🔧 Deque Operations

* `insertFront()` ➡️ Add at front
* `insertRear()` ➡️ Add at rear
* `deleteFront()` ❌ Remove from front
* `deleteRear()` ❌ Remove from rear
* `getFront()` 🔍 Peek front
* `getRear()` 🔍 Peek rear
* `isEmpty()` / `isFull()` ❓ Check status

### 🧰 Implementation Methods

* 🌀 **Circular Array** → Uses `%` to wrap `front` and `rear` pointers.
* 🔗 **Doubly Linked List** → Efficient O(1) insertions/deletions at both ends.

### 📌 Use Cases

* 🔄 **Undo/Redo** systems
* 🌐 **Browser history navigation**
* 🔁 **Palindrome checkers**
* 🧮 **Sliding window algorithms** (e.g., max in subarrays)

## 🥇 Priority Queue

A **Priority Queue** allows elements to be dequeued based on **priority**, not arrival order.

### 📋 Rules of Operation

* ⚡ Higher-priority elements are served first.
* 📌 If priorities are equal → process by **FCFS (First Come, First Served)**.

### 📚 Types

* 🔽 **Min-Priority Queue (Ascending)** → Lower value = higher priority.
* 🔼 **Max-Priority Queue (Descending)** → Higher value = higher priority.

### 🛠️ Operations

* `insert(item, priority)` ➕ Add with priority
* `deleteHighestPriority()` ❌ Remove highest priority
* `getHighestPriority()` 🔍 Peek highest priority

### 🧰 Implementation Techniques

* 📂 **Unsorted List** → Insert = O(1), Delete = O(n)
* 📑 **Sorted List** → Insert = O(n), Delete = O(1)
* 🌲 **Binary Heap (Recommended)** → Insert & Delete = O(log n)

### 📌 Use Cases

* ⚙️ **CPU Scheduling**
* 🗺️ **Dijkstra’s / Prim’s algorithms**
* 📦 **Huffman Coding (Compression)**
* 🎮 **A* Search in Games & AI*\*

## ⚠️ Common Problems & Solutions

### 🌀 Deque Issues

| Problem             | Description                  | ✅ Solution                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Overflow**        | Adding to a full array deque | Use dynamic array or linked list |
| **Underflow**       | Removing from empty deque    | Check `isEmpty()` before delete  |
| **Wraparound Bugs** | Front/Rear go out of bounds  | Use modulo `%` operator          |

### ⏳ Priority Queue Issues

| Problem                  | Description                        | ✅ Solution                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Slow Operations**      | Arrays/lists lead to O(n)          | Use Binary Heap (O(log n))                   |
| **Duplicate Priorities** | Conflicts on same priority         | Use timestamp or insertion order             |
| **Starvation**           | Low-priority items never processed | Use **aging** to increase priority over time |
