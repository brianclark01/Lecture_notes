- ⚡ **Logic Levels**:
  - Logic 1: `~2V to 5V`
  - Logic 0: `~0V to 0.8V`
- ✅ **Advantages of Digital Systems**:
  - Programmability 🛠️
  - High Reliability 🔒
  - Accuracy 🎯
  - Easy Storage & Replication 💾
  - Scalable Design 📐

## 🔢 2. Number Systems

A **number system** defines a way to represent numbers using digits or symbols, based on a **radix/base**.

### 🧮 Types of Number Systems:
- 🔟 **Decimal** (Base-10): 0–9
- 0️⃣1️⃣ **Binary** (Base-2): 0, 1 → 🌟 *Foundation of digital logic*
- 8️⃣ **Octal** (Base-8): 0–7
- 🔟🔠 **Hexadecimal** (Base-16): 0–9, A–F

### 🔁 Conversions:
- Decimal ↔️ Binary/Octal/Hex: ✔️ Division & multiplication methods.
- Binary ↔️ Octal/Hex: Grouping bits (3 for Octal, 4 for Hex).

### ➕ Binary Arithmetic:
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division 🔄

### ➖ Complements:
- 🔄 **1’s Complement**: Flip bits (0 ↔ 1)
- ➕ **2’s Complement**: Add 1 to 1’s complement ➡️ *used for subtraction*

### ➗ Signed Number Representations:
- ➕➖ **Sign-Magnitude**
- ➖ **1’s Complement**
- ➖ **2’s Complement**

### 🔡 Digital Codes:
- 🧮 **Weighted Codes**: e.g., 8421 BCD
- ⚖️ **Non-Weighted Codes**: e.g., Excess-3, Gray Code
- 🧾 **BCD (Binary Coded Decimal)**: 4-bit per digit
- ➕ **Excess-3 (XS-3)**: Add 0011 to BCD
- 🌗 **Gray Code**: Only 1-bit change between codes (unit distance)

### ⚠️ Error Detection & Correction:
- 🛡️ **Parity (Even/Odd)**: Detects single-bit errors
- ✅ **Hamming Code**: Corrects single-bit errors
  - Parity bits: Positions in powers of 2
  - Formula: `2^k ≥ n + k + 1`

### 🔤 Alphanumeric Codes:
- 🆎 **ASCII (7-bit)**
- 🖥️ **EBCDIC (8-bit)**

## 🧮 3. Boolean Algebra

Boolean algebra is a mathematical system dealing with binary logic (0 & 1).

### ✍️ Basic Concepts:
- **Introduced by**: George Boole (1847)
- **Logic levels**:
  - Positive logic: 0 = False, 1 = True
  - Negative logic: 0 = True, 1 = False

### 🔧 Operations:
- 🔄 **NOT (Complement)**: `A̅`
- ➕ **OR**: `A + B`
- ✖️ **AND**: `A · B`

### 🧠 Operator Precedence:
`( )` → `NOT` → `AND` → `OR`

### 📚 Boolean Laws:
- **Commutative**: `A + B = B + A`
- **Associative**: `A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C`
- **Distributive**: `A(B + C) = AB + AC`
- **AND Laws**: `A·0 = 0`, `A·1 = A`
- **OR Laws**: `A+0 = A`, `A+1 = 1`
- **NOT Laws**: `A̅̅ = A`, `1̅ = 0`, `0̅ = 1`
- **Absorption Laws**: `A + AB = A`, `A(A + B) = A`
- **De Morgan’s Laws**:
  - `A + B̅ = A̅ · B̅`
  - `A · B̅ = A̅ + B̅`

### ✅ Truth Tables:
Used to represent **Boolean expressions** explicitly by listing all input-output combinations.

## ⚙️ 4. Logic Gates

Logic gates are the **hardware realization** of Boolean functions.

### 🔑 Gate Types:
- 🔹 **Basic Gates**: AND, OR, NOT
- 🔄 **Universal Gates**: NAND, NOR → *Can implement all others*
- 🔁 **Derived Gates**: XOR, XNOR

Each gate has:
- **Symbol**
- **Truth Table**
- **Boolean Expression**

## 🧾 5. Representation of Boolean Expressions

### 🧩 SOP & POS Forms:
- **Sum of Products (SOP)**:
  - Output is 1 when any product (ANDed term) is 1.
  - **Minterms**: Represented as `m_j` or `∑m`
- **Product of Sums (POS)**:
  - Output is 0 when any sum (ORed term) is 0.
  - **Maxterms**: Represented as `M_j` or `ΠM`

### 🔄 Converting Canonical Forms:
- `∑ → Π`: List missing terms from truth table.
- `m_j = M̅_j`

## 🗺️ 6. Karnaugh Map (K-Map) Simplification

K-Maps offer a **graphical method** for minimizing Boolean expressions.

### 🧱 Structure:
- Number of cells = `2^n` (n = number of variables)
- Cells filled with:
  - 1s for SOP
  - 0s for POS

### 📐 Grouping Rules:
- Adjacent cells only (no diagonals)
- Groups must be **power of 2** (2, 4, 8…)
- Can **wrap around**
- Groups may **overlap**
- Maximize group size for simplicity

### ❓ Don't Care Conditions:
- Marked as `X` or `φ`
- Can be used as 1 or 0 to aid simplification

### 🔍 Implicants:
- **Prime Implicant (PI)**: Any valid group
- **Essential Prime Implicant (EPI)**: Unique coverage of minterms
- **Redundant PI (RPI)**: Entirely covered by others
- **Selective PI (SPI)**: Chosen when not essential but helpful

### ⚠️ Limitations:
- Manual and inefficient for >6 variables.
