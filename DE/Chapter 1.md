## 🧠 1. Introduction to Digital Electronics

Digital Electronics is the **core of modern computing and communication systems**. It plays a vital role in designing everything from microcontrollers to complex embedded systems.

### ⚡ Analog vs Digital:
| Feature        | Analog Systems                       | Digital Systems                        |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Signal Type    | Continuous                           | Discrete (binary)                      |
| Accuracy       | Less (susceptible to noise)          | High (immune to noise due to voltage ranges) |
| Hardware       | Amplifiers, Oscillators              | Logic gates, Flip-flops                |
| Example        | Thermometer, Tape recorder           | Calculator, Digital watch              |

> **Example**: A traditional mercury thermometer is analog, while a digital thermometer with a 7-segment display is digital.

### 🔌 Logic Levels:
- **Logic 0 (LOW)**: 0V to 0.8V  
- **Logic 1 (HIGH)**: 2V to 5V  
  These ranges allow noise immunity (i.e., the system can tolerate slight voltage changes).

## 🔢 2. Number Systems

Digital systems use various number systems depending on the context. The **binary system** is fundamental in digital logic.

### 🎯 Common Number Systems:
| Number System | Base | Digits Used      | Example         |
|---------------|------|------------------|------------------|
| Decimal       | 10   | 0–9              | 348              |
| Binary        | 2    | 0, 1             | 1011 (binary of 11) |
| Octal         | 8    | 0–7              | 57 (octal of 47)   |
| Hexadecimal   | 16   | 0–9, A–F         | 2F (hex of 47)     |

### 🔁 Conversions with Examples:
#### 🔸 Decimal to Binary:
**Example**: Convert 19₁₀ to Binary  
→ 19 ÷ 2 = 9 R1  
→ 9 ÷ 2 = 4 R1  
→ 4 ÷ 2 = 2 R0  
→ 2 ÷ 2 = 1 R0  
→ 1 ÷ 2 = 0 R1  
**Result**: 19 = **10011₂**

#### 🔸 Binary to Decimal:
**Example**: 1011₂ = ?  
→ (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = **11₁₀**

#### 🔸 Binary to Octal:
Group bits in 3s from right: `101101` = `000 101 101` → 5 5 → **55₈**

#### 🔸 Binary to Hex:
Group bits in 4s from right: `101101` = `0010 1101` → 2D → **2D₁₆**

### ➕ Binary Arithmetic:
| Operation     | Rule                             |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| 0 + 0         | 0                                |
| 1 + 0 / 0 + 1 | 1                                |
| 1 + 1         | 10 (carry 1)                     |
| 1 + 1 + 1     | 11 (carry 1, write 1)            |

**Example**:  
```

1101

* 1011

---

11000

```

### 🧮 Complements:
Used to **perform subtraction** by adding.

#### 🔹 1’s Complement:
Flip all bits.  
**Example**: 1101 → 0010

#### 🔹 2’s Complement:
Add 1 to 1’s complement.  
1101 → 0010 → 0011

---

### ➖ Signed Numbers:
- **Sign-Magnitude**: `1001` = -1  
- **1’s Complement**: Flip bits  
- **2’s Complement**: Preferred in computers

### 🧾 Digital Codes:

| Code         | Type         | Usage/Feature                        |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| BCD          | Weighted     | Decimal to 4-bit binary              |
| Excess-3     | Non-weighted | Self-complementary (add 3 to BCD)    |
| Gray Code    | Non-weighted | Only one bit changes → less error   |
| ASCII        | Alphanumeric | 7-bit character code (A = 65)        |
| EBCDIC       | Alphanumeric | IBM-specific 8-bit code              |
| Hamming Code | ECC          | Error detection and correction       |

#### 🧪 Example: BCD
Decimal 7 = `0111`  
Decimal 13 = 1 → `0001`, 3 → `0011` → BCD: `0001 0011`

## 🔍 3. Boolean Algebra

A mathematical tool to express and simplify logic operations.

### 🔧 Operators and Symbols:
| Operation | Symbol | Meaning                     |
|----------|--------|-----------------------------|
| NOT      | A̅      | Inverts input                |
| AND      | A·B     | True if A AND B are true     |
| OR       | A + B   | True if A or B is true       |

#### 💭 Example:
**Expression**: `A + A·B`  
Using Absorption Law: `A + AB = A`

### 🔢 Truth Table:
| A | B | A + B | A · B | A̅ |
|---|---|--------|--------|----|
| 0 | 0 |   0    |   0    |  1 |
| 0 | 1 |   1    |   0    |  1 |
| 1 | 0 |   1    |   0    |  0 |
| 1 | 1 |   1    |   1    |  0 |

## ⚙️ 4. Logic Gates

Used to **implement logic expressions** physically.

### 🔹 Basic Gates:
- **AND**: Output 1 if all inputs are 1  
- **OR**: Output 1 if any input is 1  
- **NOT**: Inverts the input

### 🔁 Universal Gates:
- **NAND**: NOT of AND  
- **NOR**: NOT of OR  
→ Can construct any digital circuit using just NAND or NOR.

### 🔀 Derived Gates:
- **XOR**: 1 if inputs are different  
- **XNOR**: 1 if inputs are the same

## 🧾 5. Boolean Expression Representation

### 🧩 SOP (Sum of Products):
→ Output HIGH for minterms.

**Example**: `F(A, B) = A̅B + AB`

### 🔸 Minterm Table:
| A | B | Output | Minterm |
|---|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | 1 |   1    | A̅B     |
| 1 | 1 |   1    | AB      |

→ `F = ∑m(1,3)`

### 🛒 POS (Product of Sums):
→ Output LOW for maxterms.

**Example**: `F = (A + B̅)(A̅ + B)`

---

## 🗺️ 6. Karnaugh Map (K-Map)

### 🔍 Why Use K-Map?
- Simplifies Boolean expressions easily
- Reduces gate count
- Ideal for manual design (≤6 variables)

### 🧱 Layout Example (2-variable K-map):

```

```
 B
```

0   1
A -------
0 | 1 | 1 |
1 | 0 | 1 |

```

→ Group 1s: Simplified expression

### 🧠 Grouping Tips:
- Use powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8...
- Group edge-wrapping cells
- Include don't-cares if they help simplify

### ❓ Don't Care Example:
For a 3-variable function:  
`F(A,B,C) = ∑m(1,3,7)` with `d(2,6)`

Include minterms **1, 3, 7**, and optionally 2 or 6 to simplify.

## ✅ Implicants & Simplification Strategy

| Term         | Meaning                                       |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **PI**       | Prime Implicant: Valid groupings              |
| **EPI**      | Essential PI: Cover minterm(s) uniquely       |
| **RPI**      | Redundant: Covered elsewhere                  |
| **SPI**      | Chosen when required, not essential or redundant |
